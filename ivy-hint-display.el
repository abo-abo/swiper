;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides an informative interface for ivy.
;;
;; 1. Although Ivy has multiple modes of operation, multiple regex
;;    techniques, and multiple actions, Ivy does not give a user
;;    visual feedback of its current state of operation, this even
;;    though a user can dynamically change any of those in
;;    mid-selection. It is very easy to lose track.
;;
;; 2. Ivy users may also suffer confusion from the many keybindings
;;    for the many options that Ivy offers.
;;
;; This package addresses both those issues. It provides a
;; single-line informative display above the minibuffer, in the
;; form: "case[%s] regex[%s] action: %s%s", and optionally also
;; displays usage hints, which can be edited according to the user's
;; need.
;;
;; The features of this package are toggled by evaluating function
;; `ivy-hint-display-mode'. When the feature is enabled and focus is in
;; an ivy minibuffer, display of hints are toggled by keybinding
;; `M-?'.
;;
;; TODO:
;; 1. Each function has a single action labeled 'default', which isn't
;;    as helpful a description for a user toggling through the actions
;;    as actually saying what the default is, especially since in most
;;    cases it is just a duplicate for one of the other actions. It
;;    would be nice to have that terminology eliminated in favor of a
;;    more descriptive label.
