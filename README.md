***flexible, simple tools for minibuffer completion in Emacs***

This repository contains:

**Ivy**, a generic completion mechanism for Emacs.

**Counsel**, a collection of Ivy-enhanced versions of common Emacs
commands.

**Swiper**, an Ivy-enhanced alternative to isearch.

# Ivy

[![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/ivy-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/ivy)

Ivy is a generic completion mechanism for Emacs. While it operates
similarly to other completion schemes such as `icomplete-mode`, Ivy
aims to be more efficient, smaller, simpler, and smoother to use yet
highly customizable.

To try Ivy, just call <kbd>M-x</kbd> `ivy-mode`. This will enable
generic Ivy completion, including specific completion for file and
buffer names.

### Installation

Install the `ivy` package from MELPA / GNU ELPA.

## Documentation

### Manual
The manual is available as [HTML](http://oremacs.com/swiper/).

After installing from MELPA, the manual is also available through the `(ivy)` Info node.

The source file for the Info page is
[here](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/doc/ivy.org).

### Wiki
Ivy and Swiper wiki is here: [the wiki](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/wiki).

### Small config example
```elisp
(ivy-mode 1)
(setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t)
(setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
(global-set-key "\C-s" 'swiper)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-r") 'ivy-resume)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'ivy-resume)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'counsel-M-x)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-f") 'counsel-find-file)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f1> f") 'counsel-describe-function)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f1> v") 'counsel-describe-variable)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f1> l") 'counsel-find-library)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f2> i") 'counsel-info-lookup-symbol)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f2> u") 'counsel-unicode-char)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c g") 'counsel-git)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c j") 'counsel-git-grep)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c k") 'counsel-ag)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x l") 'counsel-locate)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-o") 'counsel-rhythmbox)
(define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd "C-r") 'counsel-minibuffer-history)
```

# Counsel

`ivy-mode` ensures that any Emacs command using
`completing-read-function` uses ivy for completion.

Counsel takes this further, providing versions of common Emacs
commands that are customised to make the best use of ivy. For example,
`counsel-find-file` has some additional keybindings. Pressing
<kbd>DEL</kbd> will move you to the parent directory.

# Swiper

[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/swiper-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/swiper)

Swiper is an alternative to isearch that uses ivy to show an overview
of all matches.

A helm version of swiper is also available:
[swiper-helm](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper-helm).

# Frequently asked questions

Q: How do I enter an input that matches one of the candidates instead
   of this candidate? Example: create a file `bar` when a file
   `barricade` exists in the current directory.

A: Press <kbd>C-M-j</kbd>. Alternatively, you can make the prompt line selectable with `(setq ivy-use-selectable-prompt t)`.
