;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package gives an overview of the current regex search
;; candidates.  The search regex can be split into groups with a
;; space.  Each group is highlighted with a different face.
;;
;; It can double as a quick `regex-builder', although only single
;; lines will be matched.
;;
;; It also provides `ivy-mode': a global minor mode that uses the
;; matching back end of `swiper' for all matching on your system,
;; including file matching. You can use it in place of `ido-mode'
;; (can't have both on at once).
