;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package gives an overview of the current regex search
;; candidates in a `helm' buffer.  The search regex can be split into
;; groups with a space.  Each group is highlighted with a different
;; face.
;;
;; It can double as a quick `regex-builder', although only single
;; lines will be matched.
