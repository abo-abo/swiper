* Reporting issues

Before reporting a bug, please take a look at:
- the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/README.md][FAQ]]
- the [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][manual]]
- the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/wiki][wiki]]
- the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues][open issues]]

To understand what's going on, we need a reproducible bug scenario.
It is important that we can rule out interference with other Emacs
packages or customizations, therefore use =emacs -Q= to bypass your
init file.

This shortcut will start =emacs -Q= for you with =ivy-mode= already
loaded:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/
cd swiper
make plain
#+end_src

* Contributing code
Here are the important settings for code style:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
(require 'cl-indent)
(setq lisp-indent-function #'common-lisp-indent-function)
(put 'if 'common-lisp-indent-function 2)
(put 'defface 'common-lisp-indent-function 1)
(put 'defalias 'common-lisp-indent-function 1)
(put 'define-minor-mode 'common-lisp-indent-function 1)
(put 'define-derived-mode 'common-lisp-indent-function 3)
(put 'cl-flet 'common-lisp-indent-function
     (get 'flet 'common-lisp-indent-function))
(put 'cl-labels 'common-lisp-indent-function
     (get 'labels 'common-lisp-indent-function))
#+end_src

The setting for =indent-tabs-mode= is automatically applied by
=.dir-locals.el=.  Emacs produces a warning when setting
=lisp-indent-function= in =.dir-locals.el=, so that line is commented
out.  Please uncomment it and add the following code to disable the
warning:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'safe-local-variable-values
             '(lisp-indent-function . common-lisp-indent-function))
#+end_src

Before submitting a change, run:
- =make compile= - check for new compilation warnings
- =make deps= - install dependencies for testing
- =make test= - check for failing tests
- =make checkdoc= - check documentation guidelines

Use your own judgment for the commit messages, I recommend a verbose
style using =magit-commit-add-log=.

This assignment works for all projects related to Emacs.  To obtain it
